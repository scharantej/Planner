 ## Problem Analysis

The goal of this project is to build a sport planner app that allows users to create and manage their own sports schedules. The app should be easy to use and accessible from any device with an internet connection.

## Design

The app will be built using the Flask framework. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building simple, yet powerful web applications.

The app will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the app. This page will allow users to create new schedules and view their existing schedules.
* `create_schedule.html`: This page will allow users to create a new schedule.
* `view_schedule.html`: This page will allow users to view an existing schedule.
* `edit_schedule.html`: This page will allow users to edit an existing schedule.
* `delete_schedule.html`: This page will allow users to delete an existing schedule.

The app will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page of the app.
* `/create_schedule`: This route will handle the creation of a new schedule.
* `/view_schedule/<schedule_id>`: This route will handle the viewing of an existing schedule.
* `/edit_schedule/<schedule_id>`: This route will handle the editing of an existing schedule.
* `/delete_schedule/<schedule_id>`: This route will handle the deletion of an existing schedule.

## Implementation

The app can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Install Flask and the necessary dependencies.
2. Create the HTML files for the app.
3. Create the routes for the app.
4. Test the app to make sure it works as expected.
5. Deploy the app to a production environment.

## Testing

The app can be tested by manually testing each of the routes. Additionally, the app can be tested using an automated testing framework such as PyTest.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to a production environment using a variety of methods. One popular method is to use a Platform as a Service (PaaS) such as Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
